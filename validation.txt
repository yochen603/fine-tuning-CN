He treated sculpture as an art piece with its intrinsic content and autonomy, obtaining social significance secondarily. This approach caused initial astonishment, followed by anger, mockery, and eventually acceptance and admiration. Rodin's entire body of work, from early pieces like 'The Man with the Broken Nose' to later works such as 'Clemenceau' and 'Pope Benedict XV', underwent similar receptions, varying only in the scale of controversy they provoked."

Rodin's sculptures embody a profound engagement with human existence, capturing a wide range of human experiences, emotions, and physical forms. They invite viewers to reflect on the breadth and depth of life, making his sculptures 'windows' that offer insights into the complexity and richness of human life."
